### 🔹 **Update #7**

  - 🧱 **Define core data models and Room entities for real estate properties, photos, and POIs.**

  - 🏠 **PropertyEntity & DAO** : 
    - Defined the PropertyEntity class to represent real estate listings in the Room database. This model includes all key attributes expected from a property:
      - Title, type (e.g. loft, house), price in dollars, surface area, number of rooms, and detailed description.
      - Address information, agent name, listing status (sold/available), entry and optional sale date.
    
    - Also implemented PropertyDao interface to handle database access:
      - Retrieve all properties, sorted either by entry date (descending) or alphabetically by title.
      - Fetch a property by ID.
      - Insert new listings or update existing ones.
      - Mark properties as sold with a timestamp, or delete them individually.
      - A method is also included to clear the database (for development/testing).
      - Introduced a multi-criteria search method using SQL conditions with optional filters (Surface area, price range, type of property, and sold status).
  
  - 🖼️ **PhotoEntity & DAO** :
    - Created the PhotoEntity class to store photos linked to a specific property. Each photo includes:
      - A reference to the associated property (via propertyId).
      - A URI to the image stored locally or remotely.
      - A textual description (e.g. "Living room", "Balcony view").

    - Developed the PhotoDao interface to manage photo data access:
      - Fetch all photos related to a given property by its ID.
      - Insert multiple photos at once (typically during property creation or editing).
      - Remove photos individually or all photos linked to a specific property (e.g. on deletion).

  - 📍 **PoiEntity & DAO** :
    - Implemented the PoiEntity data class to represent nearby points of interest (POIs) linked to a property. Each POI record includes:
      - A reference to the associated property via propertyId.
      - A name (e.g. "Central Park", "Harlem Public School").
      - A type or category (e.g. "Park", "School", "Store").

    - Built the PoiDao interface to manage interaction with POIs:
      - Fetch all POIs related to a given property using its ID.
      - Insert a list of POIs in bulk during property creation or update.
      - Delete all POIs tied to a specific property (e.g. upon property removal).
      - Allow selective deletion of individual POIs if needed (manual clean-up or updates).


### 🔹 **Update #8**

  - 🗃️ **Set up Room database and local data infrastructure.**

    - 🏗️ **RealEstateManagerDatabase**:
      - Created the RoomDatabase implementation that ties together the core Room entities: PropertyEntity, PhotoEntity, and PoiEntity.
      - Defined abstract DAO accessors: propertyDao(), photoDao(), poiDao().
      - Implemented a singleton pattern using @Volatile and synchronized block to ensure thread-safe access to a single database instance.
      - Chose not to use fallbackToDestructiveMigration() to preserve data integrity during future schema updates.
      
    - 🧩 **Repository Layer**:
      - Defined repository interfaces (PropertyRepository, PhotoRepository, PoiRepository) to abstract data access operations.
      - Implemented offline versions (OfflinePropertyRepository, OfflinePhotoRepository, OfflinePoiRepository) using Room DAOs under the hood.
      - This separation enables easier mocking/testing and supports future migration to remote or hybrid data sources.
    
    - 💼 **AppContainer & Dependency Injection**:
      - Introduced the AppContainer interface as a centralized dependency provider.
      - AppDataContainer holds lazy-initialized repository instances, each backed by the RealEstateManagerDatabase.
      - Ensures loose coupling and clean DI (Dependency Injection) throughout the app.

    - 🚀 **Application Initialization**:
      - Created RealEstateManagerApplication which initializes the AppContainer in onCreate().
      - This allows dependency access from any part of the app using context.applicationContext.


### 🔹 **Update #9**

  - 🔧 **Migrated base package name from com.openclassrooms.realestatemanager to com.dcac.realestatemanager.**

    - Updated the package declaration in all .kt source files accordingly.
    - Modified the AndroidManifest.xml to reflect the new package name

  - 🌐 **Integrated Retrofit & Kotlinx Serialization for API access**
    - Added the following libraries to support network requests and JSON parsing:
      - retrofit2 – Core networking library for HTTP API calls.
      - retrofit2-kotlinx-serialization-converter – Allows Retrofit to use kotlinx.serialization for JSON parsing.
      - okhttp3 – HTTP client used by Retrofit.
      - kotlinx-serialization-json – Official Kotlin library for JSON serialization/deserialization.
    - Configured plugin block with:
      - kotlin-serialization – Enables Kotlin’s serialization compiler plugin for handling JSON models.
    - These libraries will support integration with the Google Static Maps API to display static, offline-compatible property maps.

  - 🗺️ **Google Static Maps API Integration**
    - Defined a Retrofit interface targeting the Google Static Maps API /staticmap endpoint.
    - Created a dedicated data class to encapsulate all map request parameters like center, zoom level, size, map type, and marker definitions.
    - Implemented a centralized OfflineStaticMapRepository that orchestrates API calls, handles error logging, and manages image retrieval.
    - The repository abstracts the networking logic, exposing a clean method to get static maps as raw image byte arrays for use in the UI or for offline storage.

  - 💾 **Offline Caching Support for Map Images**
    - Extended the OfflineStaticMapRepository to persist downloaded map images to internal storage.
    - A local save method creates a subfolder in context.filesDir/maps/ to store images with custom filenames.
    - Image file paths are then persisted in the Room database and reused when displaying maps offline, avoiding unnecessary network calls.

  - 🏠 **Room Model Enhancement**
    - Extended the PropertyEntity model to include a new column for storing the path to the static map file.
    - This association allows each property to persist a visual context of its surroundings, improving user experience offline.

  - 🔐 **API Key Management via BuildConfig**
    - Moved the Google Maps Static API key out of source code and into a secure Gradle configuration (local.properties).
    - The key is injected into the app at build time using buildConfigField, allowing safe usage through BuildConfig.
    - This approach avoids exposing sensitive credentials in version control systems.


### 🔹 **Update #10**

  - 📍 **Location Permission Handling**
    - Implemented runtime permission request flow for accessing the user fine location (ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION).
    - Updated AndroidManifest.xml to declare required location permissions (ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION and ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION).
    - Added user-friendly permission rationale and error handling to ensure smooth experience when permissions are denied or revoked.
    - This setup prepares the app for integrating live user geolocation features and map display with location-based markers.
  
  - 📦 **Google Play Services & Coroutines Integration**
    - Added dependencies for Google Maps SDK, Location Services, and Kotlin Coroutines support for asynchronous location retrieval.
    - Configured Kotlin Coroutines Play Services to allow suspending functions when accessing the fused location client.

  - 🗺️ **Dynamic Location & Data Integration**
    - Implemented GoogleMapRepository that uses the fused location client to asynchronously obtain the user current location.
    - Repository streams all properties and POIs stored locally via existing Room repositories, enabling live data updates for map display.

  - 💉 **Dependency Injection Enhancements**
    - Extended AppContainer and its implementation to provide an instance of GoogleMapRepository, injecting the necessary context and offline repositories.
    - Centralized repository management to streamline future ViewModel integration and testing.


### 🔹 **Update #11**

    - Ensured secure handling of API credentials by relying on Gradle's BuildConfig, local.properties and google-services.JSON (no secrets committed to VCS).
    - This integration sets the stage for future bi-directional sync between local Room database and Firestore, enabling full offline-online data resilience.

  - 🧩 **Firebase Initialization in Application class**
    - Updated RealEstateManagerApplication to initialize Firebase using FirebaseApp.initializeApp(this).
    - Ensures Firebase services are available globally and initialized at app startup.

  - 🔐 **Authentication Abstraction Layer**
    - Introduced AuthRepository interface to define contract for user authentication logic.
    - Created OnlineAuthRepository as a Firebase-based implementation using FirebaseAuth.
    - Exposed currentUser state and observeAuthState() as a Flow of FirebaseUser to observe changes in authentication status reactively.

  - 🛡️ **Secure API Key & Secrets Handling**
    - Placed google-services.json in the app/ module.
    - Updated .gitignore to exclude google-services.json from version control, ensuring Firebase credentials are not exposed.


### 🔹 **Update #13**

  - 🧩 **Firebase Authentification Repository Injection Setup**
    - Injected OnlineAuthRepository as AuthRepository implementation within AppContainer for centralized dependency management.
    - Ensured consistent and easy access to authentication functionality across the app via dependency injection.

  - 👥 **User Data Model and Repository Implementation**
    - Introduced UserEntity Room entity with fields for email, password, and agent name.
    - Developed UserDao with standard CRUD operations and Flow support.
    - Created UserRepository interface and OfflineUserRepository implementation encapsulating data access.
    - Added domain model User and mapping extension functions for seamless entity-model conversion.

  - 🔄 **Property-POI Many-to-Many Relationship Handling**
    - Created cross-reference entity PropertyPoiCrossEntity to manage many-to-many associations between properties and POIs.
    - Updated Room schema: removed direct foreign key in PoiEntity to property; handled relations via junction table.
    - Enhanced DAO interfaces with join queries to retrieve POIs linked to properties.
    - Added composite data class PropertyWithPois using Room @Relation with @Junction to fetch relational data efficiently.

  - 🧩 **Repository and Dependency Injection Updates**

### 🔹 **Update #14**

  - 🔐 **Online-Only Account Creation**
    - User accounts must now be created online using Firebase Authentication (createUserWithEmailAndPassword).
    - The password is not stored in plain text anywhere — only the hashed version (SHA-256) is retained locally for offline authentication.
    - Upon successful signup, the user's profile (email + agent name + uid) is uploaded to Firestore under the path: users/{uid}.
    - Once both Firebase Auth and Firestore steps succeed, the account is marked as isSynced = true and saved in the local Room database for offline access.

  - 💾 **Offline Authentication (Room)**
    - Introduced a secure hashing utility using SHA-256 to hash passwords before storing them in Room.
    - The app supports offline login by comparing the hash of the entered password with the one stored locally.
    - Implemented Room DAO queries to check user existence (emailExists) and retrieve users by email.
    - Enhanced the OfflineUserRepository to transparently hash passwords during cacheUserFromFirebase().

  - 🔄 **Sync-Only Logic for User Modifications**
    - Account creation is now excluded from the sync logic.
    - UserSyncManager is responsible only for syncing modified users (e.g., email/agent name changes) from Room to Firestore.
    - Users with isSynced = false are automatically detected and synchronized when the network is available.
    - The Firebase UID is stored locally to maintain reference consistency between Firestore and Room.
    - Robust error handling is in place: failed syncs do not mark the user as synced and retry later.
    - Firestore security rules enforce write access only to authenticated users modifying their own document.

  - 🧩 **Architecture & Extensibility**
    - Clear separation of concerns:
      - ✅ FirebaseAuth handles account creation and sign-in
      - ✅ Firestore stores public user profile info
      - ✅ Room caches the user account for offline usage
      - ✅ Sync system (SyncManager & UserSyncManager) pushes changes, not creation
    - The model User and entity UserEntity include isSynced and firebaseUid to track sync state and cross-reference.
    - This setup lays the groundwork for synchronizing other entities (e.g., properties, photos, POIs) using the same principles.

  - ✅ **TL;DR**  
    - User accounts are now created online-only, authenticated offline, and synchronized intelligently with Firebase when needed. This architecture ensures security, offline resilience, and cloud consistency.

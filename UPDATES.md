# 🏠 **RealEstateManager**
**RealEstateManager** is a modern Android application aimed at helping real estate agents manage exceptional property listings from their mobile device. Built to support a digital transformation for a prestigious New York agency, the app allows agents to browse, add, edit, and geolocate real estate properties even in offline mode.
This project is developed using modern Android architecture principles, with a focus on local data persistence, modular code, and responsive design. It evolves from a legacy student prototype and will be gradually refactored and extended.

  - Migrated ConstraintLayout from legacy android.support.constraint.ConstraintLayout to androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout.
  - Updated layout namespace references accordingly.

- 🧠 **Runtime Crash Fix - NPE**:

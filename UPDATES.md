# 🏠 **RealEstateManager**
**RealEstateManager** is a modern Android application aimed at helping real estate agents manage exceptional property listings from their mobile device. Built to support a digital transformation for a prestigious New York agency, the app allows agents to browse, add, edit, and geolocate real estate properties even in offline mode.
This project is developed using modern Android architecture principles, with a focus on local data persistence, modular code, and responsive design. It evolves from a legacy student prototype and will be gradually refactored and extended.


## ✅ **Project Update History**
This file documents key technical updates applied to the RealEstateManager Android application. It serves as a detailed changelog for traceability and developer onboarding.


## ✅ **MAJOR UPDATES**

### 🔹 **Update #3**

- 🧩 **Manifest Fixes** for Android 12+ compliance:
  - Removed obsolete package="..." attribute from AndroidManifest.xml.
  - Added android:exported="true" to MainActivity to support explicit intent filters.

- 🧱 **XML Refactoring**:
  - Migrated ConstraintLayout from legacy android.support.constraint.ConstraintLayout to androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout.

  - 🔧 Switched ProGuard config to use proguard-android-optimize.txt in release builds.


### 🔹 **Update #5**

- 🧱 **Project dependency foundation and setup**:
  - ✅ Integrated Jetpack Compose using the official Compose BOM and Material3 libraries.
  - ✅ Added Room (with KTX and compiler) for local database persistence and annotation processing via KSP.
  - ✅ Included DataStore Preferences for key-value data storage (modern replacement of SharedPreferences).
  - ✅ Integrated Location Services and Google Maps SDK for geolocation and static/dynamic map rendering.
  - ✅ Configured KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processing) for Room code generation compatibility with Kotlin.
  - ✅ Added full testing stack with MockK and Truth to complement JUnit and Espresso for unit/integration testing.
  - 📦 All major libraries have been updated to their latest stable versions.

- 🎨 **UI Theming & Fonts**:
  - ✅ Added application logo as a vector asset to align with branding needs and scalable UI rendering.
  - ✅ Created a fully customized Material 3 theme using lightColorScheme() and darkColorScheme() for modern UI appearance.
  - ✅ Defined a color palette including primary, secondary, and background colors to support both light and dark modes.
  - ✅ Integrated Google Fonts via androidx.compose.ui:ui-text-google-fonts, enabling dynamic loading and usage of high-quality typography.
  - 🔤 Applied a clear typographic hierarchy:
    - DM Serif Display for titles, headlines, and large labels to reinforce elegance and impact (ideal for real estate).
    - Inter for body text and UI labels to ensure legibility and a modern feel.
  - 💡 Used Typography() and FontFamily() APIs to inject the font styles into the app MaterialTheme.
  - 🧪 Confirmed Compose preview rendering works with theming and font integration.


### 🔹 **Update #6**

  - 🧹 **Java-to-Kotlin migration & project restructuring**:
    - 🔄 Fully removed legacy Java classes including MainActivity.java, in favor of idiomatic Kotlin components.
    - 🧱 Reorganized source folders to follow MVVM architecture: data, model, ui, utils, workers.
    - 🔧 Updated AndroidManifest.xml with proper Application class and Compose theme reference.
  
  - 🛠️ **Refactored Utils.java to Kotlin**:
    - ✅ Migrated to Utils.kt as an object, following Kotlin best practices.
    - ✅ Preserved the three original methods (convertDollarToEuro, getTodayDate, isInternetAvailable) with improved implementations:
      - ✅ Internet check now supports API 21+ via version-aware logic.
      - ✅ Currency conversion and date formatting are simplified and localized.
    - 📲 Updated method logic to use ConnectivityManager with NetworkCapabilities or NetworkInfo fallback.
    - 🛡️ Removed any direct calls to APIs not available on Android 5.0.


### 🔹 **Update #7**

  - 🧱 **Define core data models and Room entities for real estate properties, photos, and POIs.**

  #### 🏠 **PropertyEntity & DAO** : 
  Defined the PropertyEntity class to represent real estate listings in the Room database. This model includes all key attributes expected from a property:
    - Title, type (e.g. loft, house), price in dollars, surface area, number of rooms, and detailed description.
    - Address information, agent name, listing status (sold/available), entry and optional sale date.
    
  Also implemented PropertyDao interface to handle database access:
    - Retrieve all properties, sorted either by entry date (descending) or alphabetically by title.
    - Fetch a property by ID.
    - Insert new listings or update existing ones.
    - Mark properties as sold with a timestamp, or delete them individually.
    - A method is also included to clear the database (for development/testing).
    - Introduced a multi-criteria search method using SQL conditions with optional filters (Surface area, price range, type of property, and sold status).
  
  #### 🖼️ **PhotoEntity & DAO** :
  Created the PhotoEntity class to store photos linked to a specific property. Each photo includes:
    - A reference to the associated property (via propertyId).
    - A URI to the image stored locally or remotely.
    - A textual description (e.g. "Living room", "Balcony view").

  Developed the PhotoDao interface to manage photo data access:
    - Fetch all photos related to a given property by its ID.
    - Insert multiple photos at once (typically during property creation or editing).
    - Remove photos individually or all photos linked to a specific property (e.g. on deletion).

  #### 📍 **PoiEntity & DAO** :
  Implemented the PoiEntity data class to represent nearby points of interest (POIs) linked to a property. Each POI record includes:
    - A reference to the associated property via propertyId.
    - A name (e.g. "Central Park", "Harlem Public School").
    - A type or category (e.g. "Park", "School", "Store").

  Built the PoiDao interface to manage interaction with POIs:
    - Fetch all POIs related to a given property using its ID.
    - Insert a list of POIs in bulk during property creation or update.
    - Delete all POIs tied to a specific property (e.g. upon property removal).
    - Allow selective deletion of individual POIs if needed (manual clean-up or updates).

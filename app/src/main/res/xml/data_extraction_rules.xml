This XML file defines rules for data extraction (e.g., via ADB commands)
introduced in Android 12 (API 31+).

Used by the `android:dataExtractionRules` attribute in the manifest.

You can restrict which files and data types are visible to external tools
during backup/restore or forensic access, enhancing user data protection.

   Sample data extraction rules file; uncomment and customize as necessary.
   See https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/backup-restore#xml-changes
   for details.
